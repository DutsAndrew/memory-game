How To:
1. Try to click all 8 cards to win the game
2. Each round the 8 cards will randomly be placed; try to remember which ones you have & haven't clicked
3. Once you've clicked all 8 cards you win the game.

Tools:
1. For this project I mainly used React JS, HTML, and CSS.

What I learned:
1. React isn't as hard as I thought it would be, I can already see the components aspect helping compartmentalize my code more.
2. I think the useState and useEffect hooks are much easier and cleaner to use than React classes.
3. React is going to be a really good tool to have as I learn and master it more... I'm starting to see how it allows you to render individual components to save memory and keep an application running smoothly. I'm looking forward to building more with it.
